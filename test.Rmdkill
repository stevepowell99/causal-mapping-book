### The basic rule

```{r,echo=F}
DiagrammeR::mermaid('
graph LR
B(Influence variable B)-->E(Consequence variable E)
C(Influence variable C)-->E(Consequence variable E)
D(Influence variable D)-->E(Consequence variable E)

',height=200)
```

This is a "mini-map": one or more variables are shown with arrows leading to another. 


```{r,echo=F}
DiagrammeR::mermaid('
graph LR
x

',height=200)
```
> A mini-map in which one or more variables (the "influence variables") are shown with arrows leading to another ("the consequence variable") says, for example: "the influence variables B, C and D all have some kind of causal influence on the consequence variable E".  That sentence is equivalent to the map above.
