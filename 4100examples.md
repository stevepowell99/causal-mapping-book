### Theories gathered from activists

#### The question I sent

At last night's meeting, we talked about an easy exercise to help us build a "theory of change" for our group. Our "theory of change" will be a little story and/or diagram which will say, in a nutshell, what we are trying to do, and why. Which levers are we trying to press by doing the things we do, by e.g. hosting a petition, giving out stickers, and what is supposed to happen as a consequence?

One way to do this would be by all sitting round a flipchart, but another way is to ask each of you what you think, and I'll combine the ideas. We can ask the Council officers too and we can compare their ideas to ours.

So all you have to do, if you'd like to participate, is to send me your short answer to the two questions below. I've also provided a jokey "model answer", below, but you can write what you want, just 1-8 sentences altogether.  There is no right or wrong way to answer and don't worry about speling!

Here are the two questions:
1) What factors could lead to the successful extension of the SL to Clevedon?
What do you think are the factors which will help make it happen (or make parts or sections of it happen)? Are there any factors that make it *less* likely? Do these helping (and hindering) factors influence one another?
2) What will happen because of the extension of the SL to Clevedon, once we have it (or parts of it)? What things will get better, will any things get worse? Do these things influence or reinforce one another?

Please send your answers to steve@pogol.net (having to post them here might put some people off). It isn't strictly anonymous though - I won't write your name when I combine the information into a bigger picture, but others might be able to guess who said what.

Jokey model answer:

I think the main point is to stick up so many posters that they can be seen from space. When we have enough, the aliens are sure to see them. As long as we make our idea clear enough, the aliens will obviously agree with us and either exert mind control over the council or just build the extension from space with lasers. Then everyone will see how easy cycling is and will plead with the aliens to build more and more cycle tracks, and everyone will rush to Clevedon to witness the new cycling paradise, as long as the aliens do not scare them off.
