# Context



If one or more variables A,B,... influence a variable Z in a context C, can we recast this so that the information about the context is replaced by an additional variable C which also influences Z (maybe in interaction with the variables A, B...)?

#### Note on context

This rule only works as stated providing both mini-maps are *from the same context*. All maps actually have a context attached to them in which they are claimed, stated, posited, uttered, etc. I am not going to deal much with context at this point, i.e. I will assume that all the maps come from the same unspecified context, but it is really important. In general, the combined map is only true in the *intersection* of the contexts. (So if one map is true for females, and the other is true only for young people, the combined map is true only for girls).
