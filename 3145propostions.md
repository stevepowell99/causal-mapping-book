# Variables versus propositions and events

obvious that in event based scenarios we have nothing like the same kind of predictability 
I think about event based historical scenarios is the cause does not just create a causal pulse on the next variable but also creates the next variable

the special thing about the “given” operator is you don’t need to calculate what happens in the other half

films like event based or billiard pool tables are worse because the outcome variable normally isn’t what it looks like, the counterfactual is wrong
variable based systems are good not only because you can chain explanations but because you can usually do good calculations about attribution
