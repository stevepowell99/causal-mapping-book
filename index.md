# What's in this book

It's mainly about the new app for coding causal fragments. I've called it `Theorymaker`, actually `Theorymaker 4` to distinguish it from my older text-based version, but this could change.

We'll look at:

- the need for the app
- a guide to the app
- tips on coding

There's also an annex on how to use the original Theory Maker app, Theorymaker *text*

- a guide to the app
- tips on coding


There will also be general materials on harder issues in the coding and meaning of causal networks.
