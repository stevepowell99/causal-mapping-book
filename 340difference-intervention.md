# Interventions

You can also specify “intervention” values for (some of the) exogenous variables, in which case Theorymaker can calculate the “effect” of an intervention on a downstream variable, defined as the “difference” between the predicted value under intervention and the predicted base value, i.e. the value without intervention.
