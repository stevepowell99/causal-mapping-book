# Have a look at the slides

I already have a set of slides which covers the basic approach to coding causal information which I'm promoting. 

The thing is, they are written mostly from the planning approach of "how should we draw a diagram for this organisation's theory of change" whereas what you are looking for I think is "how should we code this causal statement", and I believe the first is anyway just a special case of the second. 

So you might like to look at the slides with that in mind. 

- Slides 109 - 123, http://www.pogol.net/public/slides.html#/overview-mistakes, which is a do's and don'ts section. 
- There is a more thorough introduction on slides 13 to 45. 

A caveat: In the slides I make a lot of use of grouping boxes which group together sets of variables, which isn't unfortunately available in my the new version of Theorymaker.
